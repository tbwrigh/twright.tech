Howdy! My name is Tyler, and I live in Denver, Colorado. I started coding in my early teens and have never looked back. I currently work at Career TEAM as a Lead Software Engineer. Previously, I have worked for Tyler Technologies and the National Security Agency.

__My goal in life is to make the world a better place with the software I create.__

When I'm not coding, you can find traveling the world, listening to music, trying new restaurants, watching anime, and hanging out with my amazing friends!
